# Dynamic Symbol Filter Configuration
# Add these lines to your .env file to enable dynamic symbol filtering

# ---------- Dynamic Symbol Filter ----------

# Enable/disable dynamic filtering (true = enabled, false = use static list only)
DYNAMIC_FILTER_ENABLED=true

# Performance thresholds for auto-exclusion
# Symbols are excluded if they meet ANY of these criteria:

# Minimum win rate (30% = 0.30)
# Symbols with win rate below this are excluded
DYNAMIC_FILTER_MIN_WIN_RATE=0.30

# Minimum average P&L per trade in USD
# Symbols averaging worse than this per trade are excluded
DYNAMIC_FILTER_MIN_AVG_PNL=-5.0

# Minimum total P&L in USD over lookback period
# Symbols with total losses exceeding this are excluded
DYNAMIC_FILTER_MIN_TOTAL_PNL=-50.0

# Maximum average bid-ask spread percentage (2% = 0.02)
# Symbols with spreads wider than this are excluded
DYNAMIC_FILTER_MAX_SPREAD_PCT=0.02

# Minimum number of trades required for statistical significance
# Symbols with fewer trades are not evaluated
DYNAMIC_FILTER_MIN_TRADES=5

# Lookback period in days for performance analysis
DYNAMIC_FILTER_LOOKBACK_DAYS=30

# Permanent exclusions (comma-separated, will NEVER be auto-included)
# Use this for symbols you want to ALWAYS exclude regardless of performance
# Example: HODL coins, SHILL coins, broken symbols
PERMANENT_EXCLUSIONS=

# ---------- Notes ----------
# - Exclusion list is cached for 1 hour, refreshed automatically
# - Symbols can be auto-included when performance improves
# - Permanent exclusions override dynamic filtering
# - If dynamic filtering is disabled, uses static fallback list in code
