# Session: Trade-Strategy Linkage Integration
**Date**: December 29, 2025
**Start Time**: 11:45 AM PT
**Status**: 🟢 Active

---

## Session Overview

Following successful 24-hour verification of blacklist expansion (zero trades on FARM-USD, XLM-USD, AVT-USD), this session focuses on completing the critical trade-strategy linkage integration to enable parameter optimization.

**Previous Session**: December 28, 2025 - Optimization Infrastructure Fixes
**Branch**: `feature/strategy-optimization`
**Context**: Trade-strategy linkage at 0% - blocking optimization work

## Goals

### Primary Goal
Complete trade-strategy linkage integration to achieve 100% linkage rate between trades and strategy parameters.

### Specific Objectives
1. **Design metadata flow architecture**
   - Strategy metadata (score, snapshot_id) generated in sighook
   - Orders placed by webhook
   - Trades recorded when orders fill (websocket events)
   - Need to bridge these 3 systems

2. **Implement metadata caching**
   - Store strategy metadata when decisions are made
   - Retrieve metadata when trades are recorded
   - Handle race conditions and timeouts

3. **Integrate linkage calls**
   - Hook into webhook order placement
   - Call `create_strategy_link()` when buy orders fill
   - Call `update_strategy_link()` when sell orders fill

4. **Test and verify**
   - Place test trades
   - Verify linkage records created
   - Confirm 100% linkage rate

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Strategy metadata flows from sighook → webhook → trade_recorder
- [ ] Buy orders create linkage records with buy_score and indicator_breakdown
- [ ] Sell orders update linkage records with sell_score and trigger_type
- [ ] Database query shows >90% linkage rate for new trades
- [ ] No performance degradation in order placement

## Progress

### Infrastructure Ready (from Dec 28 session)
- ✅ `TradeStrategyLink` SQLAlchemy model created
- ✅ `create_strategy_link()` method in TradeRecorder
- ✅ `update_strategy_link()` method in TradeRecorder
- ✅ Database table exists in production

### Current State
- ⚠️ Linkage methods exist but not called
- ⚠️ No metadata flow between sighook and webhook
- ⚠️ Current linkage rate: 0%

### Next Steps
1. Analyze existing order flow to identify integration points
2. Design metadata caching strategy
3. Implement metadata capture in sighook
4. Implement metadata retrieval in webhook
5. Add linkage calls when trades are recorded
6. Test with live trades

## Notes

**Verification Results (Dec 29)**:
- ✅ Blacklist deployment successful
- ✅ 0 trades on FARM-USD, XLM-USD, AVT-USD
- ✅ 21 trades on other symbols (normal activity)
- ✅ Container stable for 21 hours

**Key Challenge**:
Trade-strategy linkage requires bridging 3 separate systems:
1. **Sighook** (TradingStrategy) - generates strategy decisions
2. **Webhook** (order placement) - executes orders
3. **WebSocket** (trade recording) - records filled orders

The metadata needs to flow through all 3 systems to link trades with strategy parameters.
